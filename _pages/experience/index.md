        description: Connect with the rugged Welsh landscape by feasting on its autumnal larder. In Pembrokeshire, Llys Meddyg offers beach foraging short courses year-round. Hunt for razor clams, samphire, sea buckthorn berries and more, ready to be cooked up for the day’s lunch. Brecon Beacons Foraging takes you to the heart of the valleys, showing you the tips and tricks you need to make the most of the natural riches of the land. Bespoke courses take it a step further – botanic gin session anyone?

        title: Canal Barge Trip
        description: Once the industrial lifeline for much of Wales, the canal network now offers a leisurely way of seeing the rolling valleys of the Welsh interior. Head for the effortlessly picturesque town of Llangollen, where a wild slate river sits parallel to a steam train and a canal. The canal still offers horse-drawn boat tours, but for a truly remarkable experience, take a barge across the nearby Pontcysyllte Aqueduct, a World Heritage Site,  which supports the canal over its lofty travels across the wide Dee valley.

        title: Cycle the Coast Path
        description: The Wales Coast Path is a unique adventure, one unending trail that covers the entire country’s coastline. Thing is, there’s 870 miles of it, so your choices for remote rides are as diverse as the landscapes you’ll discover. A highlight for amateurs and pros alike is the Mawddach Trail, which snakes along the route of an old train line. Expect gorgeous coastal views, crossing old wooden bridges and winding through bird sanctuaries as you cycle from charming Dolgellau to beautiful Barmouth.

        title: Stargazing
        description: Wales is packed with designated Dark Sky locations, stretching from Snowdonia down to Pembrokeshire. Across Wales, tours offer a variety of expeditions to embark on as the sun goes down, from long walks and camping under the stars to upright paddle-boarding across moonlit lakes. But by all means, keep it simple; find a hill, grab some blankets and a picnic hamper, and delight at the show.

        title: Canoe the Wye Valley
        description: The Wye is a truly idyllic waterway that cuts from mid-Wales down to the Severn estuary. Hire a canoe and discover the beauty of the valley. Half a day will see you gliding into Hay-on-Wye, a remarkable stop. Or, head south and discover Monmouth with a stopover. Tintern Abbey and Chepstow Castle sit on the river’s banks further downstream, as the river closes in on the Severn.
