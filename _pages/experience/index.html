        title: Climb the Peaks
        description: Whether it’s hiking to their summit, abseiling down their sheer drops, or hurtling down their slopes on a mountain bike, the Welsh hills and mountains are a playground for outdoor adventures. Snowdon, the highest peak in Wales, already poses a formidable challenge to any avid climber. To really test your endurance, try the Welsh 3 Peaks Challenge, encompassing Cadair Idris and Pen y Fan – a 24 hour challenge covering 17 miles and 1500 metres.

        title: World’s Longest Zip Line
        description: What to do with an abandoned slate mine? Well, build the world’s longest and fastest zip line of course! Zip World has made north Wales the capital of adrenaline, where you can fly over a vast quarry at dizzying speeds of up to 125mph. But there’s more; a whole underground cavern filled with adventure awaits. Zip World is a truly unique experience.

        title: Cliff Camping, Cliff Climbing
        description: The Welsh sure know how to live life on the edge. Whether it’s hanging off the edge or jumping off the edge, either is truly daring. Spend the night in a tent suspended down steep cliff sides, with the ocean roaring beneath. Or, throw caution to the wind and launch yourself into the bitter sea, on a guided coasteering day for unrivalled fun. Both unique experiences are, naturally, available here in Wales.

From technically demanding tracks like those found in Antur Stiniog, Snowdonia or the Brecon Beacons, to picturesque and more forgiving spots like the Elan Valley, Wales has no shortage of premiere mountain biking destinations.

        title: Stargazing
        description: Wales is packed with designated Dark Sky locations, stretching from Snowdonia down to Pembrokeshire. Across Wales, tours offer a variety of expeditions to embark on as the sun goes down, from long walks and camping under the stars to upright paddle-boarding across moonlit lakes. But by all means, keep it simple; find a hill, grab some blankets and a picnic hamper, and delight at the show.

        title: Canoe the Wye Valley
        description: The Wye is a truly idyllic waterway that cuts from mid-Wales down to the Severn estuary. Hire a canoe from Wye Valley Canoes and discover the beauty of the valley. Half a day will see you gliding into Hay-on-Wye, a remarkable stop. Or, head south and discover Monmouth with a stopover. Tintern Abbey and Chepstow Castle sit on the river’s banks further downstream, as the river closes in on the Severn.
