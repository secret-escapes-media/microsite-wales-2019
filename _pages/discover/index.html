        description: 22 miles of unspoilt coastline is ready to be explored, along a beautiful stretch of mid-Wales. The designation ‘heritage coast’ marks and protects the coves and beaches, recognising their untouched qualities and conserving them. Walking trails tie the whole stretch together, with seaside towns like Abaereron, Aberystwyth and Cardigan making great stop-offs as you explore this beautiful coast.

        title: Gower Peninsula
        description: The UK’s first ever Area Of Outstanding National Beauty certainly lives up to the moniker, with idyllic coastal walks and gorgeous beaches. The waves make it a surfer paradise, the cliffs attract coasteering, and humble walkers are rewarded with exquisite scenery. Gower is a truly beautiful place to escape to, an easy rival to neighbouring Pembrokeshire.
